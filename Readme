# MentiConn.ai 🚀

**Sync with the Hive Mind. Peps > Solo.**

MentiConn.ai is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to bridge the "Guidance Gap" for engineering students and early-career developers. It creates a hybrid feedback loop by combining instant AI technical mentorship with a human network of seniors and peers.

## 🧐 The Problem
Millions of students graduate every year, but many lack "industry-readiness." They face:
* **The Guidance Void:** Seniors are busy, and professors are academic-focused.
* **Generic Advice:** YouTube roadmaps are one-size-fits-all.
* **Isolation:** Tier-2/3 college students often lack a network of like-minded builders.

## 💡 The Solution
MentiConn is not just an AI wrapper; it is a growth ecosystem that offers:
1.  **Nexus AI Mentor:** Instant feedback on code, resume reviews, and mock interviews using advanced LLMs.
2.  **Project Marketplace:** A space to buy and sell high-quality, verified codebases (Learn + Earn).
3.  **Smart Connections:** Filter and find peers by Role (SDE/Data) or College to build projects together.
4.  **Real Mentorship:** Book 1:1 sessions with verified industry professionals.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
We built MentiConn using a lightweight, high-performance stack:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS (for the responsive, Glassmorphism UI)
* **AI Integration:** FastRouter API (Orchestrating OpenAI GPT-4o & Anthropic Claude 3.5)
* **Libraries:**
    * `SweetAlert2` (For beautiful, interactive modals)
    * `Marked.js` (For rendering Markdown in AI chat)
    * `FontAwesome` (For iconography)
* **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel
